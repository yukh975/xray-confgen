# Changelog

## v1.0.2 — 2026-03-21

### UI
- Password reveal button uses SVG icons (open / crossed-out eye) that toggle on click
- Named section titles: Inbound, VLESS, Databases, Routing, Logging
- Uniform vertical spacing between all form sections
- Field labels simplified: removed redundant "Inbound" from IP and port labels
- Field labels horizontally aligned with input fields
- Hint texts simplified
- Page title and H1 updated to "Xray config generator"
- Project renamed from "vless-parser" to "xray-confgen" (Xray config generator)
- Routing section is now collapsible (hidden by default); all optional sections collapsed on first load
- Result `config.json` is displayed in a centered modal popup (same style as error dialog) with backdrop and close button
- Result config modal closes only via the ✕ button; backdrop click and Escape do not close it
- Escape key closes the Help and error modals
- Value picker dropdown: added clear-all ✕ button (shown only when items are selected)
- DNS, Routing, Logging sections now have a consistent toggle-to-expand pattern
- Help button (?) added next to language switcher; opens a modal with usage guide and language switcher

### Features
- **DNS section** added:
  - Enable toggle with collapsible block
  - DNS servers list: presets (Google DoH, Cloudflare DoH, Yandex DoH, Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS, Yandex DNS) or custom with name + address fields
  - DNS rules: assign geo-database tags to specific DNS servers (same picker as routing)
  - Fallback DNS server, query strategy (UseIP / UseIPv4 / UseIPv6 / ForceIP / ForceIPv4 / ForceIPv6 / useSystem), domain strategy (AsIs / IPIfNonMatch / IPOnDemand)
  - All DoH presets use IP addresses to avoid bootstrap DNS dependency
- **Routing section**: routing config is only emitted when the section is enabled
- Custom DNS server row includes a Name field used as label in rule selectors

### Bug fixes
- DNS rule server selector displayed literal translation key instead of server label
- Value picker in DNS rule rows always used the initial database instead of the current selection
- Picker dropdown was clipped by the Logging section below (`overflow: hidden` → `overflow: visible`)
