# Changelog

## v1.0.3 — 2026-03-21

### UI
- Dark/light theme toggle button (sun/moon icon) in the header; dark theme is the default
- Theme preference is saved to `localStorage` and restored on page load without flash
- Routing **Presets** button in the routing section opens a multi-select dropdown: Russia, Iran, Block ads, All through proxy, Block BitTorrent
  - Presets are additive — they add rules without replacing existing ones; duplicates are skipped
  - Multiple presets can be active simultaneously; unchecking a preset removes only the rules it added
  - Preset rules are filtered to only use databases available on the server
- **Block BitTorrent** moved from a standalone checkbox into the Presets dropdown
- **Clear rules** button added to both Routing and DNS sections
- Routing section button layout: Presets on the left, Add rule / Clear rules on the right; same for DNS rules
- **Share** button encodes the full form state into a URL-safe base64 parameter (`?s=…`); the link can be opened on any device to restore the exact configuration; shared URL is cleaned from the address bar after state is restored
- "VLESS URL" renamed to "VLESS URI" everywhere: field label, subtitle, help content

### Features
- **Mux section** added between DNS and Logging: enable toggle (default: off), `concurrency`, `xudpConcurrency`, `xudpProxyUDP443`; automatically skipped when Reality + `xtls-rprx-vision` flow is used
- **HTTP inbound**: button in the Inbound section adds an HTTP proxy inbound (`127.0.0.1:8080` by default); IP and port are configurable; clicking ✕ removes it; only one HTTP inbound is allowed
- **Sniffing section** added between VLESS and Databases: enable toggle (default: on), protocol checkboxes (`http`, `tls`, `quic`, `bittorrent`), and `routeOnly` option; sniffing config is only emitted when the section is enabled
- **Import config.json** button: load an existing `config.json` back into the form — all fields (inbound, VLESS URI, routing rules, DNS, logging) are populated automatically; the configuration can then be adjusted and regenerated
- **DNS server deduplication**: each preset can appear in the list only once; clicking *Add server* auto-selects the first unused preset; changing an existing server to a preset already in the list shows an error and reverts the selection
- **Mobile layout**: the interface is fully responsive on smartphones — field rows stack vertically, rule rows reflow to two lines, touch targets enlarged, iOS auto-zoom prevented

### Bug fixes
- Tag picker showed stale tags after switching databases: a race condition caused a completed `fetchTags()` call to overwrite `knownTags` after `resetPicker()` had already run; fixed with a sequence counter that invalidates in-flight fetches

## v1.0.2 — 2026-03-21

### UI
- Password reveal button uses SVG icons (open / crossed-out eye) that toggle on click
- Named section titles: Inbound, VLESS, Databases, Routing, Logging
- Uniform vertical spacing between all form sections
- Field labels simplified: removed redundant "Inbound" from IP and port labels
- Field labels horizontally aligned with input fields
- Hint texts simplified
- Page title and H1 updated to "Xray config generator"
- Project renamed from "vless-parser" to "xray-confgen" (Xray config generator)
- Routing section is now collapsible (hidden by default); all optional sections collapsed on first load
- Result `config.json` is displayed in a centered modal popup (same style as error dialog) with backdrop and close button
- Result config modal closes only via the ✕ button; backdrop click and Escape do not close it
- Escape key closes the Help and error modals
- Value picker dropdown: added clear-all ✕ button (shown only when items are selected)
- DNS, Routing, Logging sections now have a consistent toggle-to-expand pattern
- Help button (?) added next to language switcher; opens a modal with usage guide and language switcher

### Features
- **DNS section** added:
  - Enable toggle with collapsible block
  - DNS servers list: presets (Google DoH, Cloudflare DoH, Yandex DoH, Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS, Yandex DNS) or custom with name + address fields
  - DNS rules: assign geo-database tags to specific DNS servers (same picker as routing)
  - Fallback DNS server, query strategy (UseIP / UseIPv4 / UseIPv6 / ForceIP / ForceIPv4 / ForceIPv6 / useSystem), domain strategy (AsIs / IPIfNonMatch / IPOnDemand)
  - All DoH presets use IP addresses to avoid bootstrap DNS dependency
- **Routing section**: routing config is only emitted when the section is enabled
- Custom DNS server row includes a Name field used as label in rule selectors

### Bug fixes
- DNS rule server selector displayed literal translation key instead of server label
- Value picker in DNS rule rows always used the initial database instead of the current selection
- Picker dropdown was clipped by the Logging section below (`overflow: hidden` → `overflow: visible`)

### UI
- Favicon added: dark background, thin blue X with 8 ray dots (16×32×48 px)
- SVG logo added to the left of the page title
- "Source code on GitHub" link added to the footer

### Docs
- README rewritten: Features section replaced with full usage guide (from the help modal)
- Demo link added: https://yukh.net/xray-confgen/
- SVG logo added to README titles
- Geo database download links added to the Installation section
