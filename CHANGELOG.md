# Changelog

## v1.0.4 — 2026-03-22

### UI
- VLESS section now supports multiple entries — each with an optional **Name** field and the URI; click **+ Add VLESS** to add more servers, ✕ to remove
- **Balancer** section added between VLESS and Sniffing: enable toggle, strategy selector (random / leastPing), observatory probe URL and interval (shown only for leastPing)
- Routing rule action dropdown and **Default outbound** selector are now dynamic: they reflect the current set of VLESS tags (and include a `balancer` option when the balancer is enabled)
- VLESS name field placeholder shows the auto-generated tag name (proxy, proxy2, …)
- Labels above the Name and URI fields aligned with their input edges
- Remove (✕) button vertically aligned with the URI textarea instead of the top of the row
- **Duplicate VLESS URI detection**: entering the same URI in two rows highlights the duplicate in red and shows an error immediately
- **URI validation on submit**: each VLESS row must have a non-empty URI starting with `vless://`; invalid rows are highlighted in red and generation is blocked

### Security
- Added `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `X-Frame-Options: DENY` headers to all PHP API endpoints
- Inline theme-init script moved to `assets/theme-init.js` to enable a strict `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'` in nginx
- Nginx config example updated: security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy`) and rate limiting (`limit_req_zone`, 20 r/s, burst 30) added
- Reserved tag names (`direct`, `block`, `balancer`) are now rejected both in the UI (real-time, with red highlight) and in the PHP backend

### Features
- **Multiple outbounds**: each VLESS entry becomes a separate outbound in the config; tags are derived from the Name field or auto-assigned (proxy, proxy2, …)
- **Balancer**: when enabled, a `balancers` block is added to routing with the configured strategy; routing rules and the catch-all can target the `balancer` outbound; enabling with fewer than 2 VLESS entries is blocked with an error
- **leastPing strategy**: when selected, an `observatory` top-level block is added with the configured probe URL and interval
- **Import config.json** updated: all VLESS outbounds are imported as separate entries; balancer and observatory settings are restored
- Post-quantum crypto: `encryption=mlkem768x25519plus...` and `pqv` fields are parsed from VLESS URI and included in the outbound user entry; correctly restored on config.json import
- **Share modal**: clicking Share opens a modal with a QR code (compressed with deflate for scannability) and the full configuration URL displayed on screen; a Copy button lets you copy the URL from the modal; if the URL is too long for QR (e.g. due to a PQ key) a warning is shown and the link is still available
- **Scan QR → paste URI**: each VLESS row now has a "Paste from QR" button — opens camera on mobile / file picker on desktop, decodes the QR image with jsQR and fills in the URI field
- Multi-select picker (routing rules, DNS rules): checked items appear at the top of the dropdown, sorted alphabetically; re-sorted on every check/uncheck
- **DNS server deletion**: deleting a server that is referenced by DNS rules is now blocked with an error message "Remove or reassign those rules first"; indices in rules referencing higher-indexed servers are decremented automatically
- Default routing rules simplified: removed `geosite:ru → direct` and `geoip:ru → direct`; defaults are now `geoip:private → direct` and `geosite:category-ads-all → block`
- DNS rule buttons (Add / Clear) are right-aligned

## v1.0.3 — 2026-03-21

### UI
- Dark/light theme toggle button (sun/moon icon) in the header; dark theme is the default
- Theme preference is saved to `localStorage` and restored on page load without flash
- Routing **Presets** button in the routing section opens a multi-select dropdown: Russia, Iran, Block ads, All through proxy, Block BitTorrent
  - Presets are additive — they add rules without replacing existing ones; duplicates are skipped
  - Multiple presets can be active simultaneously; unchecking a preset removes only the rules it added
  - Preset rules are filtered to only use databases available on the server
- **Block BitTorrent** moved from a standalone checkbox into the Presets dropdown
- **Clear rules** button added to both Routing and DNS sections
- Routing section button layout: Presets on the left, Add rule / Clear rules on the right; same for DNS rules
- **Share** button encodes the full form state into a URL-safe base64 parameter (`?s=…`); the link can be opened on any device to restore the exact configuration; shared URL is cleaned from the address bar after state is restored
- "VLESS URL" renamed to "VLESS URI" everywhere: field label, subtitle, help content

### Features
- **Mux section** added between DNS and Logging: enable toggle (default: off), `concurrency`, `xudpConcurrency`, `xudpProxyUDP443`; automatically skipped when Reality + `xtls-rprx-vision` flow is used
- **HTTP inbound**: button in the Inbound section adds an HTTP proxy inbound (`127.0.0.1:8080` by default); IP and port are configurable; clicking ✕ removes it; only one HTTP inbound is allowed
- **Sniffing section** added between VLESS and Databases: enable toggle (default: on), protocol checkboxes (`http`, `tls`, `quic`, `bittorrent`), and `routeOnly` option; sniffing config is only emitted when the section is enabled
- **Import config.json** button: load an existing `config.json` back into the form — all fields (inbound, VLESS URI, routing rules, DNS, logging) are populated automatically; the configuration can then be adjusted and regenerated
- **DNS server deduplication**: each preset can appear in the list only once; clicking *Add server* auto-selects the first unused preset; changing an existing server to a preset already in the list shows an error and reverts the selection
- **Mobile layout**: the interface is fully responsive on smartphones — field rows stack vertically, rule rows reflow to two lines, touch targets enlarged, iOS auto-zoom prevented

### Bug fixes
- Tag picker showed stale tags after switching databases: a race condition caused a completed `fetchTags()` call to overwrite `knownTags` after `resetPicker()` had already run; fixed with a sequence counter that invalidates in-flight fetches

## v1.0.2 — 2026-03-21

### UI
- Password reveal button uses SVG icons (open / crossed-out eye) that toggle on click
- Named section titles: Inbound, VLESS, Databases, Routing, Logging
- Uniform vertical spacing between all form sections
- Field labels simplified: removed redundant "Inbound" from IP and port labels
- Field labels horizontally aligned with input fields
- Hint texts simplified
- Page title and H1 updated to "Xray config generator"
- Project renamed from "vless-parser" to "xray-confgen" (Xray config generator)
- Routing section is now collapsible (hidden by default); all optional sections collapsed on first load
- Result `config.json` is displayed in a centered modal popup (same style as error dialog) with backdrop and close button
- Result config modal closes only via the ✕ button; backdrop click and Escape do not close it
- Escape key closes the Help and error modals
- Value picker dropdown: added clear-all ✕ button (shown only when items are selected)
- DNS, Routing, Logging sections now have a consistent toggle-to-expand pattern
- Help button (?) added next to language switcher; opens a modal with usage guide and language switcher

### Features
- **DNS section** added:
  - Enable toggle with collapsible block
  - DNS servers list: presets (Google DoH, Cloudflare DoH, Yandex DoH, Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS, Yandex DNS) or custom with name + address fields
  - DNS rules: assign geo-database tags to specific DNS servers (same picker as routing)
  - Fallback DNS server, query strategy (UseIP / UseIPv4 / UseIPv6 / ForceIP / ForceIPv4 / ForceIPv6 / useSystem), domain strategy (AsIs / IPIfNonMatch / IPOnDemand)
  - All DoH presets use IP addresses to avoid bootstrap DNS dependency
- **Routing section**: routing config is only emitted when the section is enabled
- Custom DNS server row includes a Name field used as label in rule selectors

### Bug fixes
- DNS rule server selector displayed literal translation key instead of server label
- Value picker in DNS rule rows always used the initial database instead of the current selection
- Picker dropdown was clipped by the Logging section below (`overflow: hidden` → `overflow: visible`)

### UI
- Favicon added: dark background, thin blue X with 8 ray dots (16×32×48 px)
- SVG logo added to the left of the page title
- "Source code on GitHub" link added to the footer

### Docs
- README rewritten: Features section replaced with full usage guide (from the help modal)
- Demo link added: https://yukh.net/xray-confgen/
